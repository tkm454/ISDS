# Group 26 Repo for Introduction to Social Data Science (ISDS) 2023, exam project 

Group members: Oscar Frost, Bertram Illum, Simon Knobelauch Hansen 

This is the repositaoru for group 26 of the ISDS summer school 2023 exam project. This READ_ME is a brief guide on how to navigate the code for our project. 

## Reader's guide: 
Our repository consists of 2 Jupyter notebooks:

1. `PGAproject_2023`
2. `PGAproject_2022`

First run the `PGAproject_2023`, then `PGAproject_2022`. The difference between the notebooks is the that the 2023 version draws data on the unfinished 2023 season, while the 2022 version draws data on the finished 2022 season. We provide them in different notebooks, as the data fetching process required adjustments to each season. The 2022 contains only the code for earnings. Feel free to reach out with any questions. 

The project is about:
